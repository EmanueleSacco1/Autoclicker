## How It Works

1. **Installation:** Run the Python script. If any libraries are missing, they will be installed automatically.
2. **Point Selection:** Press the default hotkey (F1) or the one you've set to start the selection process, and click on the desired points on the screen. Press the default hotkey (F2) or the one you've set to stop the selection.
3. **Set the Interval:** Specify the desired time interval between clicks.
4. **Start/Stop:** Press the default hotkey (F6) or the one you've set to start or stop the auto-clicker.
5. **Edit Points:** If necessary, you can manually edit the coordinates of the selected points using the appropriate section of the interface.
6. **Hotkey Settings:** Customize the hotkeys to your liking through the settings menu.

## Requirements
